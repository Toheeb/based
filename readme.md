Based is a list of web pages that have been redesigned with [Base CSS](https://github.com/toheeb/base)

The primary goal is to improve Base CSS for use in production.

You'll need 2 things: 

- Live Server, or a similar tool, to load the index.html of each page

- Internet to load the version of Base CSS used on the page
