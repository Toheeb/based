I saw Carl Beaverson's [post on X](https://x.com/ToheebDotCom/status/1921981966519332952) looking for Web Developers â€” Nice. Let me kill 2 birds with one stone. Let me test Base CSS on his minimalistic website and shoot a shot at the gig.

## Better Document Structure

4 main actions improved the document structure. ![Before & After of Document Structure](./images/cb-ds-comparison.png)

- Putting contents in their respective window. 

  The primary window showcases the works, while the 2 secondary windows presents the contact and subscribe windows respectively.

- Provision of an heading for contents in the main frame of the window.

- Removal of 2 extraneous visual components for each work presentation.

  These components were hacks to improve performance but they should have been hidden untill needed.

- Mark each work presentation as a self-contained component that it is. Then, specify the link on the image itself.

Here is an excerpt for the document tree: ![Markup Tree](./images/markup-tree.png)

## Personalisable Design

There's more to using an harmonius system for scaling visual elements. ![Before & After of the Visual Design](./images/cb-design-comparison.png)

Users can now personalise the design in many ways

- Use any typeface: ![Screenshots of designs with Inter Typeface, Serif Font Family, Monospace Font Family, and Cursive Font Family](./images/cb-ff-comps.png)

- Use any color hue in the light mode that the original design supports. ![](./images/cb-ch-degrees.png)

And more via the Personalisation Window. Be it to bump and scale sizes or manage line and block spaces. ![](./images/p-settings.png)
